# Statistics

## General idea of project

The end-result will be a Jupyter Notebook.

That notebook will visualize all the concepts form the statistics course by using a dataset of Bitcoin prices.

## What I hope to learn

- More experience in Python
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks
- Learning statistics and use it
